This repository contains code for basic functionalities in R. It either comes (although modified by myself) from a couple of R teachers I follow online, or have been written entirely by me. 
There are several ways you can use this code as a beginner:
a) copy the code to your source pane in R studio and run it to see how different packages, functions, and arguments work.
b) make changes in the code, see how it impacts the output (remember, ctrl + Z is your best friend).
c) if you cannot make sense of a package, data set, or function, press F1 to pull help in the output pane.
d) if it doesn't make sense, ask chatGPT or Bard to explain it to you. Remember, the clearer your prompt, the better it will understand your problem and answer it.
e) lastly, if you find an issue in the code, get in touch. It will help us both.

Happy learning!
